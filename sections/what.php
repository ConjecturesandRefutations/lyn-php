        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Emanating as Pearl Tantra, a non-dual shamanic tantrik yoga practice born in Cape Town. Tantra loosely refers to the transmutation of sexual or dense frequency energy into Divine Energy.
          Our direct reference point is the body, where much is held, revealed, released and integrated. The bulk and initial groundwork is made up of embodiment practices – 
          breathwork, massage, touch and movement drawing from a range of deeply lived methods like yoga asanas and pranayama, voicing, fascia release, trauma releasing exercises…

        <p>Sessions typically consist of the powerful combo of consult inquiry and embodiment. Initially guided by myself – 
          tantrika and founder of Pearl Tantra, Mana Muse – the practice is for individuals as well as couples.

         In-person sessions are dependent on my location and discretion.</p>
         <p>Online sessions are a worthwhile exploration in and of themselves and now is the perfect time. 
          As with all things working online has some limitations, however most parts of the practice can be 
          included and it is proving a valuable container for creativity, mirroring and consolidating connection with oneself. 
          I am enlivened by the opportunity for new emerging creations and in establishing solid foundations toward potential practise in person.</p>
          <p>For sincere practitioners who are called and ready, I facilitate next level energetic activation and initiation.

        <p>An embodied journey toward surrendered Presence, through which life force can flow and we are truly breathed moved and expressed 
          perhaps even into orgasmicness for Life itself.</p>
          <p>Heart activation and healing takes place through working with light and sound energy frequencies (sound is light in the form 
            of motion, a way to move light). Meditating on the receiving and giving loop of sustainable energy, to a final resting into the abyss of silence and the stillness of nothingness.</p>
            <p>In slowing down, we bring consciousness and reverence into as many moments as we can. In this opening to Life there is the gift of the channel for communion and prayer, through 
              which we can also integrate Oneness down into daily life as ceremony. Ordinary takes on new depth of meaning and sparkle of essence.</p>
