        <p>Those drawn to Pearl Tantra are willing to be guided through intuitive processes and are open to the flow of the feminine way. Having a clearly defined container allows relaxation into the true receptivity, sensitivity, beauty, chaos, creativity, nourishment, vulnerability and strength of The Deep Feminine Itself, which in turn gives rise to The Divine Masculine, within the individual and therefore greater collective. Pearl Tantra is birthed of my experience. In putting all questions, ideas and expectations aside, the offering is for pure receiving through direct experience.
